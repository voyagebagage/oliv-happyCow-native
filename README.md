# happyCow-native-Replica

### => One word about Happy Cow's app: 
it is app that can find for you all the vegan and vegetarian solutions( restaurants) around you, and actually any restaurants <=

This is a project I realised on my own during my Bootcamp and keep on making it because where I am we need an app like that one where I would implement post section for "daily dish" and a system of delivery which is already organise by a friend. I have done the back end too with node.js => here

## So far I have implemented:

- A Home Screen including:
                         1. The map in the background with a color code for different type of Restaurant + call outs
                         2. The map has a radius max, made with geolib, that display results within
                         3. a search bar (which liks to my server/back end)
                         4. I am using the reanimated bottom sheet to display some filters & results 
                         5. You can cumulate search bar results and filters together like in the real app
                         6. The bottom sheet is on infite loading and display a sum up of each restaurant
                         7. a Tab Bar including the Home screen and the Yummiests screen for favorites

- A Restaurant Screen including:
                         1. Full information of the restaurant 
                         2. color coded background for each type of restaurant
                         3. Favorite buttons: add, remove, clear

- A Yummiests Screen including:
                         1. All the Favorites added (Yummies) with color coded type restaurant

 ## What needs to be added:
                         1. a Filter screen to groupe all the filters in one page with a radius SLIDER
                         2. make pretty the Restaurant screen
                         3. Possibility to clear or remove favorite from the Favorite screen
                         4. make the call outs like in the real app
                         5. a post section in the Tab bar to see what is ready to be delivered that
                           will navigate to the delivery section with price and What's App button
                         6. A Login/Sign up screen for Restaurants only
